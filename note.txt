// its only for fixing bug in vscode its not for production later
for typescript 
in backend we use ts as a dev dependencies so 
npm install "--save-dev typescript"
// for nodejs in express we have to install a diff package for types of ts
npm install --save-dev @types/express
// for node also 
npm install --save-dev @types/node
// for typescript config file
npx --init tsc


// we create a src folder to write a ts code 
in ts config file set
rootDir = "src"
// we create a build folder for store ts code in js form 
outDir = "build"

// to convert src ko ts file to js in build folder 
npx tsc
// for running both command 
"start":"npx tsc && node build/app.js" instead of this its better to 
npm i tsc-node 

//database
npm i sequelize
npm i mysql2
npm i --save-dev @types/sequelize

//rimraf is for delete the specified folder and file
  "build":"rimraf ./build && tsc" 
  // build a nodemon.json file for starting after saving the code 
  {
    "watch": ["src"],
    "ext": ".ts,.js",
    "ignore":[],
    "exec":"npx ts-node ./src/app.ts"
}and
"scripts": {
    "start": "npx nodemon",
    "build":"rimraf ./build && tsc" 
}

// for a better security 
we use .env and g=ignore it 
to connect databse through .env file we have to use package
npm i dotenv
npm i sequelize-typescript
